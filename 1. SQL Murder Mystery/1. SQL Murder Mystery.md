**This task covers:**
- The syntax: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY 
- Joining tables, identifying keys 
- A little use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

**Solution:**

**1. Look at crime records for witnesses**

   ```
   -- crime was a murder in SQL city and happened on 15th Janurary 2018
   Select * from crime_scene_report
   where city="SQL City" AND type="murder" AND date=20180115
   ```

**2. Search for witness records**

   ```
    Select *
    from Person
    where address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr" OR
    (address_street_name = "Franklin Ave" AND name LIKE "Annabel %")
    ORDER BY address_number desc
   ```

**3. Look for witness statements**

    
    Select *
    from interview
    where person_id=14887 OR person_id=16371


**4. Check for gym details as per the interview**


    Select *
    from get_fit_now_member as gm
    join get_fit_now_check_in as gc
    on gc.membership_id=gm.id
    where gm.id like "48Z%" and gc.check_in_date=20180109
  

**5. Check driving license details to narrow the list of suspects**

    
    Select d.plate_number,p.name
    from drivers_license as d
    join person as p
    on d.id=p.license_id
    where plate_number like "%H42W%"
    AND p.id=28819 OR p.id=67318

    
**Bonus Task**


**6. Check records as per suspects interview**

    
    select ssn,p.id
    from drivers_license as d
    join person as p
    on p.license_id=d.id
    where height >=65 AND height <=67
    and hair_color="red"
    and car_make="Tesla"
    

**7. Check Facebook event records to find the _murderer_**

    
    select *
    from facebook_event_checkin as f
    join person as p
    on p.id=f.person_id
    where event_name="SQL Symphony Concert"
    and person_id= 78881 OR person_id=90700 OR person_id=99716
